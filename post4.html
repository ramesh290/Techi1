<h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Artificial intelligence</em>&nbsp;(<em>AI</em>) is the sub intelligence exhibited by machines or software, and the branch of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>&nbsp;that develops machines and software with animal-like intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents," where an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent">intelligent agent</a>&nbsp;is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a>, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the study of making intelligent machines".</p>

<p>The central functions (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning">planning</a>, learning, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a> (communication), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception">perception</a> and the ability to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics#Manipulation">move and manipulate objects</a>. General intelligence (or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">strong AI</a>") is still among the field's long-term goals. Currently, popular approaches include deep learning, statistical methods, computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI. There is an enormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics.</p>

<h3>3D printing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has been posited by&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Rifkin">Jeremy Rifkin</a>&nbsp;and others as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution">third industrial revolution</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Combined with Internet technology, 3D printing would allow for digital blueprints of virtually any material product to be sent instantly to another person to be produced on the spot, making purchasing a product online almost instantaneous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although this technology is still too crude to produce most products, it is rapidly developing and created a controversy in 2013 around the issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printed_firearms">3D printed firearms</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-19">[18]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Gene therapy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gene therapy was first successfully demonstrated in late 1990/early 1991 for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_deaminase_deficiency">adenosine deaminase deficiency</a>, though the treatment was somatic – that is, did not affect the patient's germ line and thus was not heritable. This led the way to treatments for other genetic diseases and increased interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_line_gene_therapy">germ line gene therapy</a>&nbsp;– therapy affecting the gametes and descendants of patients.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between September 1990 and January 2014, there were around 2,000 gene therapy trials conducted or approved.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup></p>

<h3>Cancer vaccines</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A&nbsp;<em>cancer vaccine</em>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine">vaccine</a>&nbsp;that treats existing&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">cancer</a>&nbsp;or prevents the development of cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as&nbsp;<em>therapeutic</em>&nbsp;cancer vaccines. There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On April 14, 2009, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendreon">Dendreon</a> Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenge">Provenge</a>, a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration_(United_States)">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup> The approval of Provenge has stimulated interest in this type of therapy.</p>

<h3>Cultured meat</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Cultured meat</em>, also called <em>in vitro meat</em>, <em>clean meat</em>, <em>cruelty-free meat</em>, <em>shmeat</em>, and <em>test-tube meat</em>, is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_calf_serum">fetal calf serum</a> taken from a slaughtered cow. In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on <em>in vitro</em> meat in the laboratory.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-time-23">[22]</a></sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat#First_public_trial">first in vitro beefburger</a>, created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-BBC5Aug-24">[23]</a></sup> There remain difficulties to be overcome before <em>in vitro</em> meat becomes commercially available.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup> Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-no-kill_carnivore-26">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-Pharma_Concepts-27">[26]</a></sup> <em>In vitro</em> meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.</p>

<h3>Nanotechnology</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Nanotechnology</em> (sometimes shortened to <em>nanotech</em>) is the manipulation of matter on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">atomic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular">molecular</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supramolecular_chemistry">supramolecular</a> scale. The earliest widespread description of nanotechnology<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-Engines1-28">[27]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-Nanotsystems-29">[28]</a></sup> referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology">molecular nanotechnology</a>. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Nanotechnology_Initiative">National Nanotechnology Initiative</a>, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometers">nanometers</a>. This definition reflects the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> effects are important at this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_realm">quantum-realm</a> scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.</p>

<h3>Robotics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Robotics</em> is the branch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology">technology</a> that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot">robots</a>,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies#cite_note-OED-30">[29]</a></sup> as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition. A good example of a robot that resembles humans is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)">Sophia</a>, a social <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot">humanoid robot</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</a>-based company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanson_Robotics_Limited">Hanson Robotics</a> which was activated on April 19, 2015.
